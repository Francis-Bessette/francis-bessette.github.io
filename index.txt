About me

I concider myself a talented mechanical engineer with a passion for exploring my various interests. With one year of relevant work experience and a wealth of skills in design and programming, I am proficient in using Solidworks, Inventor Autodesk, Python, and Java. I am also highly skilled in various manual processes such as Laser CNC, CNC milling, TIG and MIG welding, and more. 

In addition to my technical expertise, I also have a strong background in entrepreneurship. At the young age of 17, I started my own business with the help of my family and brought my younger brother on board. I am driven by my desire to learn and enrich my interest in entrepreneurship.

As a result, I brings a unique perspective to my work in mechanical engineering, blending technical knowledge with a keen understanding of business principles. Whether it's designing innovative products or streamlining complex manufacturing processes, I am always eager to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible.

If you're looking for a skilled mechanical engineer with a passion for innovation and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, I am defenetly your ideal candidate.
